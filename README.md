# BC Gaming Bot

Discord bot that checks Reddit every few hours for trending gaming content,
matches trending topics to articles from gaming news RSS feeds, and posts a
curated, deduplicated summary to a Discord channel.

## Setup

1. Create and activate a virtualenv, then install dependencies:

   ```
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows
   source .venv/bin/activate     # Linux / Raspberry Pi
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in:
   - `DISCORD_TOKEN` / `DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID` — create a bot at
     https://discord.com/developers/applications, invite it to your server
     with the `Send Messages` and `Embed Links` permissions, and copy the
     target channel's ID (enable Developer Mode in Discord to copy IDs).
   - `REDDIT_USER_AGENT` — no API key needed; Reddit's official self-serve
     app creation is now gated behind an approval process, so this bot uses
     the public, unauthenticated `reddit.com/r/<sub>/hot/.rss` feeds
     instead. Just set a distinctive User-Agent string (the default is
     fine).

3. Run it:

   ```
   python -m bc_bot.main
   ```

   The bot runs an immediate check on startup, then repeats every
   `CHECK_INTERVAL_HOURS` (default 4). State (which stories were already
   posted) is kept in a local SQLite file (`bc_bot.db`); records older than
   `RETENTION_DAYS` (default 30) are purged automatically each cycle to keep
   the footprint small on a Raspberry Pi 4.

## Testing without posting to Discord

`bc_bot.dry_run` repeats the full fetch → consolidate → enrich cycle every
10 minutes and prints what *would* be posted to the console. It records
posted items to the database (so duplicate suppression behaves exactly like
production across cycles) but never touches Discord. `DISCORD_TOKEN` /
`DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID` aren't required for this. Stop it with Ctrl+C.

```
python -m bc_bot.dry_run
```

## How it works

1. **Collect** — pull hot posts from configured subreddits (Reddit's public
   RSS feeds), scored by feed position (already hot-ranked by Reddit) times
   that subreddit's `SUBREDDIT_WEIGHTS` multiplier, so a top slot in a much
   bigger subreddit outranks a top slot in a smaller one. Recurring
   community megathreads (Daily Discussion, Free Talk Friday, Tech Support
   threads, and self-posts with a date baked into the title, e.g. "Thread -
   Week Beginning 06/29/26") are filtered out since they aren't news.
2. **Consolidate** — fuzzy-match titles across subreddits so the same story
   posted in multiple subs becomes a single higher-engagement item.
3. **Boost announcements** — items whose title looks like a new-game reveal,
   trailer, teaser, or release-date confirmation get a confidence boost, so
   announcement news ranks above reviews, discounts, patch notes, etc.
4. **Enrich** — fuzzy-match each trending topic against recent articles from
   the configured gaming RSS feeds; if no article matches, the original
   Reddit link is used instead.
5. **Post** — the top items (by confidence, then engagement) that haven't
   been posted in the last `RETENTION_DAYS` are sent to the Discord channel
   as embeds.

Any failure during a cycle (API outage, rate limit, network blip) is logged
and swallowed; the bot simply waits for the next scheduled cycle instead of
crashing.

## Deploying on a Raspberry Pi

1. Get the code onto the Pi (clone the repo, or `rsync`/`scp` it over — exclude
   `.venv`, `.env`, `bc_bot.db`, and `bc_bot.log*`, which are per-machine and
   already in `.gitignore`), then set up the venv on the Pi itself (the venv
   can't be copied from another machine/architecture):

   ```
   git clone <this-repo-url> ~/BC_BOT
   cd ~/BC_BOT
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Fill in `.env` with real `DISCORD_TOKEN` / `DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID` (see
   Setup above), then verify it works before wiring up the service:

   ```
   python -m bc_bot.dry_run
   ```

3. Install as a `systemd` service so it survives reboots. `deploy/bc-bot.service`
   already assumes `User=pi` and `WorkingDirectory=/home/pi/BC_BOT` — adjust
   those (and `ExecStart`) if your username or clone path differ, then:

   ```
   sudo cp deploy/bc-bot.service /etc/systemd/system/
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl enable --now bc-bot
   ```

   Check status and logs with:

   ```
   sudo systemctl status bc-bot
   journalctl -u bc-bot -f      # live systemd/stdout logs
   tail -f ~/BC_BOT/bc_bot.log  # the bot's own rotating log file
   ```
